## Usage

Invoke skills in Claude Code using the Skill tool:

```
You: Use the threejs-scene-setup skill to create a new scene
```

Or reference directly when describing your task:

```
You: Set up a mobile-optimized Three.js game with ECS architecture
```

Claude Code will automatically use relevant skills based on your request.

## Quick Start: Mobile ECS Game

```typescript
// 1. Install dependencies
npm create vite@latest my-game -- --template react-ts
cd my-game
npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei

// 2. Use mobile-performance skill for device detection
// 3. Use react-three-fiber-setup skill for Canvas setup
// 4. Use ecs-architecture skill for game state
// 5. Use r3f-ecs-integration skill to connect them
// 6. Use input-system skill for controls
// 7. Use touch-input-handling skill for mobile input
```

Full examples are included in each skill's documentation.
